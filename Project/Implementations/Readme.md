# ECGR-5100_Research Tools & Tech.

### To Execute the code use following commands:
1. make strassen 
2. make numpy

# Note: A timeout of 10 minutes is introduced in this project to keep the implementation practical. With increasing size of input, strassen's algorithm takes progressively longer time to complete it execution. If cpu_utilization thread encounters that the execution time has exceeded the limit of 10 minutes then it will return and kill the process.

# Results of these implementaions are stored in csv files found in the Results directory.
# plots.ipnb file reads the resultant csv files and plots the CPU Usage made by each implementation.
